# My VSCode Extensions

## Dark Theme

Based on https://github.com/HondryTravis/simple-dark and extended with my own
tweaks.

This will probably never be published. I just wanted to be able to tweak my
theme for my own uses.

## GAVRAsm Grammar

A highlighting grammar for Gerd's AVR Assembler

I might get around to publishing this when it's done. But, for now, it's still
a work in progress.
